# sample-vuejs3

## Project Details

The motive is to convert sample static files from https://github.com/vueschool/forum-mockup into a vue project. Used the data.json inside as seed data. In the flow, it is basically a simple forum website where we have different forums under different categories. In a forum there could be multiple threads and a thread will contain multiple posts from users. The loggedin user can post under a thread.
